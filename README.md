cmangos-deploy is a Docker-based solution for running [CMaNGOS][cmangos] that
focuses on providing a streamlined and user-friendly experience. It is largely
based on [vmangos-deploy][vmangos-deploy] and offers a range of features that
simplify managing a CMaNGOS setup:

- __Prebuilt Docker images for both `amd64` and `arm64`, leveraging GitHub__
  __Actions__: simply pull the provided images that have been optimized for
  size, performance and stability instead of having to re-compile CMaNGOS
  yourself every time you want to update.
- __Support for all three CMaNGOS expansions__: Classic, TBC and WotLK are each
  available as separate prebuilt images.
- __Built-in [Playerbots][playerbots] support__: bots can be spawned on demand,
  or they can populate the world automatically.
- __Seamless, automated database migrations__: when pulling the latest Docker
  images and re-creating the containers, migrations are applied automatically
  to keep your database up to date at all times.
- __A transparent and easy-to-follow user experience__: the number of different
  commands that need to be run to install and manage CMaNGOS is kept to a
  minimum. You can use the Docker CLI or any other tool that is able to manage
  Docker containers.
- __A clean and organized structure__: the CMaNGOS configuration for each
  expansion can be found in [`config/<expansion>/`](config), everything else
  that is shared between the Docker containers and your host system lives
  inside [`storage/<expansion>/`](storage).

> [!NOTE]
> The Docker images are built on a daily schedule, unless there have been no
> new commits to CMaNGOS since the last build. Additionally, every Monday, the
> latest images are rebuilt to ensure software and dependencies are up to date,
> even if there have been no updates to CMaNGOS itself.

## Classic 1.8.4 five-character raid fork

This fork gives the Classic deployment a deliberate progression boundary at
WoW patch **1.8.4 (2005-12-06)** and tunes the raids available at that date for
a raid roster of at most five total characters, including PlayerBots. It still
uses the CMaNGOS 1.12.1 client/core data model; it is a server-side content
policy, not a recreation of the 1.8.4 client executable or every historical
class/mechanics detail.

- Content target: Vanilla WoW / CMaNGOS Classic
- Raid-content cutoff: 1.8.4
- Target raid size: 5 total characters
- PlayerBots supported: yes

The cutoff follows the original release sequence: Blackwing Lair arrived in
[1.6.0](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Patch_1.6.0), Zul'Gurub in
[1.7.0](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Patch_1.7.0), and the four Dragons of
Nightmare in [1.8.0](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Patch_1.8.0). Patch
[1.8.4](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Patch_1.8.4) was the last release before
Ahn'Qiraj in [1.9.0](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Patch_1.9.0) and Naxxramas in
[1.11.0](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Patch_1.11.0).

### Raid status and tuning

| Content | Policy | Five-character baseline | Encounter-specific changes and current limitations |
| ------- | ------ | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Molten Core | Retained; maximum 5 characters | Creature health 20%, creature damage 55% | Ragnaros uses 24%/50%, summons 3 Sons of Flame; Majordomo keeps a mixed 2-elite/2-healer pack. Other multi-add encounters retain their original add counts and need playtesting. |
| Onyxia's Lair | Retained; maximum 5 characters | Creature health 20%, creature damage 55% | Onyxia uses 24%/52%; the first whelp wave is 4 and later waves are 2-3. Positioning and fear handling remain required. |
| Blackwing Lair | Retained; maximum 5 characters | Creature health 20%, creature damage 55% | Razorgore uses 25%/55% and needs 8 eggs; Nefarian uses 22%/52% and needs 10 phase-one drakonid kills. Suppression Room, Chromaggus dispels, and class calls still require a suitable composition and are the highest-risk tuning areas. |
| Zul'Gurub | Retained; maximum 5 characters | Creature health 35%, creature damage 65% | Hakkar uses 36%/60%. PlayerBots have automatic generic Zul'Gurub strategy activation, but no encounter-specific ZG strategy package yet. |
| Azuregos and Lord Kazzak | Retained | Creature health 20%, creature damage 55% | Outdoor contention, leash behavior, and terrain are unchanged. |
| Ysondre, Lethon, Emeriss, and Taerar | Retained | Creature health 20%, creature damage 55% | Original dragon-specific mechanics and add patterns remain; these are supported by the scaler but still require encounter-by-encounter playtesting. |
| Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj (AQ20) | Disabled (released in 1.9) | Not applicable | Instance template, entrances, spawns, war-effort state, and directly dependent quests are unavailable. |
| Temple of Ahn'Qiraj (AQ40) | Disabled (released in 1.9) | Not applicable | Same enforcement as AQ20, including the Scepter and gong chain. |
| Naxxramas | Disabled (released in 1.11) | Not applicable | Instance template, entrances, spawns, Scourge Invasion state, attunement, tier, crafting, and Atiesh quests are unavailable. |

These multipliers are a maintainable starting calibration, not a claim that
every retained encounter has completed live balance qualification. Generic
scaling is data-driven in `custom_raid_scaling`: a map-default row controls the
raid, while a `(map_id, creature_id)` row overrides an individual encounter.
Health is applied when a creature's maximum health is built; creature-origin
melee, spell, periodic, and scripted damage is adjusted at the central damage
boundary. Player damage, healing, threat rules, timers, and spell selection are
left intact so encounter identity is not replaced by a blanket difficulty
mode.

`Custom.RaidScaling.TargetPlayers` accepts 1-5. Multipliers and the explicit
roster-bound mechanics scale proportionally from the five-character
calibration. The supplied configuration uses five, for which PlayerBots'
native role template is **1 tank, 1 healer, and 3 damage characters**. The
`AiPlayerbot.CustomRaidTargetPlayers` guard applies to the complete group, so a
human plus four bots is the normal roster. Convert the five-character party to
a raid before entering; the normal CMaNGOS raid-group requirement remains on.
Random-bot auto-spawning stays disabled by default.

The cutoff deliberately preserves unrelated 1.8 Silithus and outdoor content.
It disables access and progression paths directly tied to the later raids, but
does not attempt to purge every 1.9-1.12 item, spell, class change, or unrelated
quest from the 1.12.1 database.

### Instant honor progression

Classic uses personal, permanent honor progression suited to a world populated
by PlayerBots. Honor is added to the character immediately; weekly standings,
brackets, rank distribution, decay, and the weekly cap are disabled. PlayerBots
count as ordinary player opponents and receive no honor penalty.

The supplied rates make outdoor PvP worth five times a Battleground kill or
Battleground bonus before the normal `Rate.Honor` multiplier is applied:

| Honor source | Rate |
| ------------ | ---: |
| Outdoor player or PlayerBot kill | `0.5` |
| Battleground player or PlayerBot kill | `0.1` |
| Battleground objective/bonus honor | `0.1` |

Repeated kills of the same target on one server day award 100%, 75%, 50%, and
25% of that source's value; the fifth and later kills award no honor. A
different target starts at full value. This follows Blizzard's documented
[original daily diminishing-return sequence](https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/23221132/wow-classic-world-bosses-and-pvp-honor-system-available).

Rank 1 still requires 15 lifetime honorable kills. After that, the permanent
rank-point thresholds are Rank 2 at 2,000, then 5,000-point steps through Rank
14 at 60,000, with progress capped at 75,000. Those thresholds preserve the
[original rank-point breakpoints](https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/23221132/wow-classic-world-bosses-and-pvp-honor-system-available)
without the competitive weekly calculation. By default a dishonorable kill can
remove progress within the current rank but cannot remove the highest rank
already attained. Recent per-target kill records are retained for 14 days so
daily diminishing returns survive restarts; older records are compacted into
lifetime kill totals.

The policy is controlled by `Custom.Honor.*` in
[`config/classic/mangosd.conf.example`](config/classic/mangosd.conf.example).
The supplied values are intentionally conservative starting points for bot-only
PvP and should be adjusted only after the runtime matrix in
[`tests/README.md`](tests/README.md) has been measured.

### Reproducible source and validation

The Classic images build locally from pinned upstream revisions and apply the
deployment-owned patches in [`patches/`](patches). A failed local patch aborts
the image build. External patch repositories remain optional and have no
hidden default.

The patch layout keeps upstream ownership clear: `patches/classic/core`
contains the data-driven scaler and encounter-script adjustments,
`patches/classic/database` contains tuning plus cutoff enforcement, and
`patches/classic/playerbots` contains group-size and raid-strategy changes.
Conceptual changes are separate files and are applied in lexical order.

| Source | Pinned revision |
| ------ | --------------- |
| `cmangos/mangos-classic` | `1b3795fcd824338938bb67a0be79cafd26231065` |
| `cmangos/classic-db` | `250a705a462c1acb457d3002359c7e0052c4dafe` |
| `cmangos/playerbots` | `21af55995bebd84bc3154730f0e69dc964e3753f` |

Copy the Classic Compose example as usual, then build before the first start:

```sh
cp compose-classic.yaml.example compose.yaml
docker compose build database realmd
docker compose up -d
```

The source-level and live database gates are documented in
[`tests/README.md`](tests/README.md). After the database becomes healthy, run
`tests/validate-classic-world.sh` to verify both retained raid accessibility
and post-cutoff raid absence against the actual imported world database.

## Install

### Dependencies

- [Docker][docker] (including [Compose V2][docker-compose])

### Using a coding agent

If you have a coding agent like [Claude Code][claude-code] or [Codex][codex]
installed, you can try a prompt similar to the following one to have it assist
you with the installation process:

```
Help me install and set up https://github.com/mserajnik/cmangos-deploy.
First, clone the repository and read the README carefully.
Then guide me through the installation process step by step, following the
README closely.
Do as much of the setup yourself as you safely can so that I only have to step
in when a manual action or personal preference is required.
Ask me about my preferences whenever a choice has to be made, explain the
relevant options clearly, and tailor your instructions to the OS I am using.
Assume that I am not familiar with CMaNGOS or Docker and that I have not read
the README myself.
For steps that I need to perform manually, give me clear instructions and exact
commands where appropriate.
Do not assume user-facing choices such as the expansion, optional services, or
networking-related preferences. Ask me whenever the README presents a
meaningful choice.
For settings that the README, the Docker Compose configuration, or the CMaNGOS
example configuration files indicate should generally be left alone, keep the
documented defaults unless I explicitly ask for something else.
Do not change settings that the README, the Docker Compose configuration, or
the CMaNGOS example configuration files indicate should not be changed.
```

The exact prompt that works best may vary depending on the coding agent and
model you use.

### Instructions

#### Cloning the repository and adjusting the CMaNGOS configuration

First, clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mserajnik/cmangos-deploy.git
cd cmangos-deploy
```

cmangos-deploy supports three expansions, each with its own configuration
directory under [`config/`](config):

- [`config/classic/`](config/classic) for Classic
- [`config/tbc/`](config/tbc) for TBC
- [`config/wotlk/`](config/wotlk) for WotLK

Pick the one matching the expansion you want to run and create copies of the
provided CMaNGOS example configuration files in that directory. For example,
for Classic:

```sh
cp ./config/classic/mangosd.conf.example ./config/classic/mangosd.conf
cp ./config/classic/realmd.conf.example ./config/classic/realmd.conf
cp ./config/classic/ahbot.conf.example ./config/classic/ahbot.conf
cp ./config/classic/aiplayerbot.conf.example ./config/classic/aiplayerbot.conf
cp ./config/classic/anticheat.conf.example ./config/classic/anticheat.conf
cp ./config/classic/mods.conf.example ./config/classic/mods.conf
```

For TBC and WotLK, the same applies with `tbc` or `wotlk` substituted for
`classic`. Note that `mods.conf.example` only ships for Classic; it does not
exist for TBC or WotLK.

Next, adjust the configuration files you have just created for your desired
setup. The default configuration should work well as a starting point, but you
may still want to adjust certain things such as the `GameType`, the `RealmZone`
or `Anticheat.*` and `Warden.*` options. Descriptions are provided for each
option in the configuration files, so you should be able to find your way
around easily.

> [!NOTE]
> The bundled `aiplayerbot.conf.example` disables auto-spawning random bots by
> default (`AiPlayerbot.RandomBotAutologin = 0`) and the bundled
> `ahbot.conf.example` disables AHBot by default
> (`AuctionHouseBot.Chance.Sell = 0` and `AuctionHouseBot.Chance.Buy = 0`).
> Both can be re-enabled by adjusting the marked options. Players can still
> spawn bots manually via the in-game command regardless.

> [!CAUTION]
> Options relating to certain things that cmangos-deploy relies on to work
> correctly (like the database connections or configured directories such as
> the `DataDir` or the `LogsDir`) should not be adjusted unless you absolutely
> need to change them and are aware of the implications (e.g., which other
> configuration options may need to be adjusted as well to avoid discrepancies
> resulting in unexpected behavior). No support will be provided for
> non-default setups.

#### Adjusting the Docker Compose configuration

Once you are done adjusting the CMaNGOS configuration, copy the Docker Compose
example file for your chosen expansion to `compose.yaml`. For example, for
Classic:

```sh
cp ./compose-classic.yaml.example ./compose.yaml
```

For TBC and WotLK, use `compose-tbc.yaml.example` or
`compose-wotlk.yaml.example` instead. The three files share the same structure
and only differ where the expansion makes them.

The upstream prebuilt images for each expansion are:

| Expansion          | Server image                               | Database image                               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Classic (`1.12.1`) | `ghcr.io/mserajnik/cmangos-server-classic` | `ghcr.io/mserajnik/cmangos-database-classic` |
| TBC (`2.4.3`)      | `ghcr.io/mserajnik/cmangos-server-tbc`     | `ghcr.io/mserajnik/cmangos-database-tbc`     |
| WotLK (`3.3.5a`)   | `ghcr.io/mserajnik/cmangos-server-wotlk`   | `ghcr.io/mserajnik/cmangos-database-wotlk`   |

The TBC and WotLK examples use the latest available upstream images. This
fork's Classic example intentionally builds the pinned custom server and
database images locally; replacing them with the upstream Classic images also
removes the 1.8.4 cutoff and five-character raid implementation. For an
unmodified deployment, you can alternatively select upstream images via their
combined revision tag. Each image is tagged with
a tag of the form
`<expansion>-core.<core-revision>-db.<db-revision>-playerbots.<playerbots-revision>`,
where each revision is a 7-character prefix of the matching commit hash. For
example, a Classic build might have the tag
`classic-core.1aea167-db.2c980fa-playerbots.c33dfac` on both the server and
database images.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you decide to select images via combined revision tag you should always
> make sure to use the same one for the `cmangos-server-<expansion>` and the
> `cmangos-database-<expansion>` images so there are no potential discrepancies
> between code and data. It is _not_ possible (or intended) to switch to images
> based on older revisions than the previous ones you used to perform a clean
> downgrade due to the database migrations.

Since the Docker images are generally built only once a day, it is unlikely
that there will be a build for every single CMaNGOS commit combination. Older
images are automatically deleted after 14 days; in practice, you should not
rely on specific images staying available beyond the point in time when you
originally pulled them. If you absolutely need images based on specific CMaNGOS
commits, you can always build them yourself instead.

> [!TIP]
> You can find all the currently available `cmangos-server-<expansion>` and
> `cmangos-database-<expansion>` images by browsing the packages listed
> [here][image-cmangos-packages].

Aside from which Docker images you want to use you mainly have to pay attention
to the `environment` sections of each service configuration. In particular, you
will want to adjust the `TZ` (time zone) environment variable for each service.
The `CMANGOS_REALMLIST_*` environment variables of the `database` service
should also be of interest; changing the `CMANGOS_REALMLIST_ADDRESS` to a LAN
IP, a WAN IP or a domain name is required if you want to allow non-local
connections.

> [!CAUTION]
> Anything in your `compose.yaml` that is not commented or explicitly mentioned
> in this README, regardless of the section, is likely something you do not
> have to (or, in some cases, _must not_) change. Doing so may lead to
> unexpected behavior and is not supported.

#### Extracting the client data

CMaNGOS uses data that is generated from extracted client data to handle things
like mob movement and line of sight. If you have already acquired this data
previously, you can place it directly into
`storage/<expansion>/mangosd/extracted-data/` and skip the next steps.

To extract the data, first copy the contents of your client directory into
`storage/<expansion>/mangosd/client-data/`. Next, run the following command,
substituting the image for the expansion you want to extract for. For example,
for Classic:

```sh
docker run \
  -i \
  -v ./storage/classic/mangosd/client-data:/opt/cmangos/storage/client-data \
  -v ./storage/classic/mangosd/extracted-data:/opt/cmangos/storage/data \
  --rm \
  --user 1000:1000 \
  --platform linux/amd64 \
  ghcr.io/mserajnik/cmangos-server-classic \
  extract-client-data
```

There are two things to look out for here:

- If you are using a Linux host and your user's UID and GID are not 1000,
  change the `--user` argument to reflect your user's UID and GID. This will
  cause the user in the container to use the same UID and GID and prevent
  permission issues on the bind mounts. If you are on Windows or macOS, you can
  ignore this (or even remove the `--user` argument altogether, if you want to)
- The Docker image must reflect the expansion you want to extract the data for

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The extractors are only included in the `amd64` images because CMaNGOS forces
> `BUILD_EXTRACTORS=OFF` on `arm64`. The `--platform linux/amd64` flag in the
> command above ensures the right image variant is used even on `arm64` hosts
> (running through emulation, which can be slow).
>
> Extracting the data can take many hours (depending on your hardware). Some
> notices/errors during the process are normal and usually nothing to worry
> about (as long as the execution continues afterwards).

Once the extraction is finished you can find the data in
`storage/<expansion>/mangosd/extracted-data/`. Note that you may want to re-run
the process in the future if CMaNGOS makes changes (to benefit from potentially
improved mob movement etc.). In case it becomes necessary to do so (e.g., if
the extraction process changes), the _[Breaking changes](#breaking-changes)_
section further below will be updated accordingly.

If you re-run the extraction, it will automatically detect previously extracted
data and ask you if you want to continue (which will overwrite the old data).
You can also skip this confirmation prompt (and force the re-extraction) by
adding the `--force` flag to the `extract-client-data` command, like this:

```sh
docker run \
  -i \
  -v ./storage/classic/mangosd/client-data:/opt/cmangos/storage/client-data \
  -v ./storage/classic/mangosd/extracted-data:/opt/cmangos/storage/data \
  --rm \
  --user 1000:1000 \
  --platform linux/amd64 \
  ghcr.io/mserajnik/cmangos-server-classic \
  extract-client-data --force
```

#### Modifying the world database with custom changes (optional)

If you want to make custom changes to the world database, it is recommended to
do so using SQL files and placing them in
`storage/<expansion>/database/custom-sql/` (a bind mount for this directory is
[configured out-of-the-box][compose-custom-sql-bind-mount]). The files in this
directory are processed on every startup, including after cmangos-deploy
re-creates the world database to apply an upstream migration edit (see the
_[What happens during an update](#what-happens-during-an-update)_ section), so
your changes survive that flow without manual intervention.

By default, all SQL files (files with a `.sql` extension) in that directory
will be processed during each startup in alphabetical order (after the world
database has been created and updated with the latest migrations). Thus, the
SQL statements in your files have to be idempotent (i.e., they can be processed
multiple times without causing issues).

You can find further details about this feature [here][compose-custom-sql].

## Usage

### Starting CMaNGOS

Once you are happy with the configuration and have extracted the client data,
you can start CMaNGOS for the first time. To do so, run:

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

This pulls the Docker images first and afterwards automatically creates and
starts the containers. During the first startup it might take a little longer
until the server becomes available due to the initial database creation.

> [!CAUTION]
> Make sure to not (accidentally) stop CMaNGOS before the database creation
> process has finished; otherwise, you will likely end up with a broken
> database and will have to delete and re-create it.

### Observing the CMaNGOS output

Especially during the first startup you might want to follow the server output
to know when CMaNGOS is up and running:

```sh
docker compose logs -f mangosd
```

Once you see the output `World initialized.` you know that the initialization
process has finished and CMaNGOS is ready.

### Creating the first account

To create the first account, attach to the `mangosd` container (make sure
[that the server is ready](#observing-the-cmangos-output) before attaching):

```sh
docker compose attach mangosd
```

After attaching, create the account and assign an account level:

```sh
account create <account-name> <account-password>
account set gmlevel <account-name> <account-level>
```

The available account levels are:

| Level | Type          |
| ----- | ------------- |
| `0`   | Player        |
| `1`   | Moderator     |
| `2`   | Game Master   |
| `3`   | Administrator |

E.g., to create an administrator account, set the account level to `3`.

> [!NOTE]
> Setting an account level of `1` or higher means that some Game
> Master-specific behavior will begin to apply to characters on that account.
> Exactly which behavior applies depends on the account level; you can modify
> some of this via the [`GM.*` options][mangosd-gm-options] in your
> `mangosd.conf`.

For TBC and WotLK, expansion-specific content is gated by an "expansion level"
that has to be set per account. New accounts default to level `0`, which
corresponds to Classic. To unlock expansion content, run:

```sh
account set addon <account-name> <expansion-level>
```

The available expansion levels are:

| Expansion | Level | Effect                      |
| --------- | ----- | --------------------------- |
| Classic   | `0`   | Default; no action required |
| TBC       | `1`   | Unlocks TBC content         |
| WotLK     | `2`   | Unlocks WotLK content       |

When you are done, detach from the Docker container by pressing
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd>. You should now
be able to log in to the game client with your newly created account.

### Stopping CMaNGOS

To stop CMaNGOS, simply run:

```sh
docker compose down
```

### Updating

To update, pull the latest images:

```sh
docker compose pull
```

Afterwards, re-create the containers:

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

> [!NOTE]
> Selecting specific images via combined revision tag (as described further
> above) will obviously prevent you from updating until you edit each
> respective service in your `compose.yaml` to pull newer images. Attempting to
> update without changing the configured images is not harmful, it will just
> not have any effect.

#### What happens during an update

cmangos-deploy detects upstream CMaNGOS commits that edit already released
migration files. Such changes would otherwise leave your databases in an
inconsistent state and require manual intervention to rectify.

By default, cmangos-deploy will
[automatically re-create your world database][compose-automatic-world-db-corrections]
when a relevant change is detected. Anything in the world database that you may
have changed (your custom NPCs and gameobjects, `npc_vendor` edits, etc.) does
not survive the re-creation, so restore those from a backup if you need them
back (or use
[custom SQL](#modifying-the-world-database-with-custom-changes-optional) to
cleanly preserve the additions/changes).

For the other databases that contain user state, cmangos-deploy cannot safely
re-create them and instead [halts startup][compose-halt-on-edits] until you
intervene; see the next section.

#### When cmangos-deploy asks you to apply changes manually

When a migration edit is detected that affects a database containing user state
(or a world database edit with automatic corrections disabled), cmangos-deploy
halts startup and prints a message naming the affected database(s) and the
GitHub link(s) to the upstream commit(s).

The container stays running while paused; nothing restarts on its own. To
resolve:

1. Open each linked commit on GitHub and read the changes.
2. Apply the equivalent SQL to the running database. From the host:
   ```sh
   docker compose exec database mariadb -u root -p <database>
   ```
   where `<database>` is `characters`, `realmd`, `logs`, or `mangos`. `mariadb`
   will prompt for the password; it matches your `MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD`
   setting in `compose.yaml`.
3. When you are done, confirm by running on the host:
   ```sh
   docker compose exec database cmangos-confirm-changes
   ```

cmangos-deploy will then record the acknowledgement and continue startup. If
you instead want to abort, run `docker compose down`.

> [!CAUTION]
> When you run `cmangos-confirm-changes`, cmangos-deploy treats the listed
> commits as applied and continues. It does not check your database to verify
> that the changes you made match what the commits describe. If your manual fix
> is incorrect or incomplete, the database will be in an inconsistent state and
> CMaNGOS may fail to start. The responsibility for matching what the commits
> do is yours; cmangos-deploy provides no further support for resolving these
> issues.

#### Breaking changes

It is recommended to regularly check this repository (either manually or by
updating your local repository via `git pull`). Usually, the commits here will
just consist of maintenance and potentially new CMaNGOS configuration options
(that you may want to incorporate into your configuration).

Sometimes, there may be new features or changes that require manual
intervention. Such breaking changes will be listed here (and removed again once
they become irrelevant), sorted by newest first:

- __[2026-07-28] - The suggested database backup solution has changed__: the
  example Compose configuration now uses
  [`databack/mysql-backup`](https://github.com/databacker/mysql-backup) instead
  of `tiredofit/db-backup`, whose repository has moved to a new organization
  that announced a release for April 2026 which never happened, leaving it
  unclear whether the project is still maintained. If you have the
  `database-backup` service enabled, replace it with the
  [updated service configuration][compose-database-backups]; none of the
  environment variables carry over. Existing backups stay readable, but the new
  service neither prunes nor restores them, so move or delete the old `.sql.gz`
  files once you no longer need them. New backups are written as a single
  `.tgz` archive per run that contains one `.sql` file per database.

### Creating database backups

It is recommended to perform regular database backups, particularly before
updating.

To automatically create database backups periodically, uncomment the
[`database-backup` service configuration][compose-database-backups] in your
`compose.yaml` and follow the comments for further information.

Once the service is enabled, you can also create a backup on demand by running
the following (clearing `DB_DUMP_CRON` is necessary because a schedule and a
one-off run cannot be combined):

```sh
docker compose run --rm -e DB_DUMP_CRON= -e DB_DUMP_ONCE=true database-backup
```

#### Restoring a backup

To restore a backup, first stop the `realmd` and `mangosd` services:

```sh
docker compose stop realmd mangosd
```

The restore drops and re-creates the tables in the affected databases, which
would cause read and write errors in the running services and could leave the
data in an unknown state. Then run the following, replacing the file name with
the backup you want to restore:

```sh
docker compose run --rm database-backup restore --target /backup db_backup_<timestamp>.tgz
```

Finally, start the services again:

```sh
docker compose start realmd mangosd
```

### Accessing the database

To make certain changes (e.g., managing accounts or changing the realm
configuration) it can be necessary to access the database with a MySQL/MariaDB
client.

A common web-based MySQL/MariaDB database administration tool called
[phpMyAdmin][phpmyadmin] is included and can be enabled by uncommenting the
[`phpmyadmin` service configuration][compose-phpmyadmin] in your
`compose.yaml`. See the comments there for further information.

### Database security

It is not recommended to expose your database to the public (whether through
direct port access, a WAN-accessible phpMyAdmin instance, or any other means).
If you decide to do so, you will have to implement appropriate security
measures. Please note that no further support or guidance regarding this will
be provided here.

> [!CAUTION]
> The default database users with full access to all CMaNGOS data (`root` and
> the user named via the `MARIADB_USER` environment variable) do not have any
> restrictions in place in regards to which IPs/hosts can connect.
